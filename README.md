# Project Documentation: Software Development Stages

This repository includes a detailed PDF document titled **"Software_Project_Stages.pdf"**, which outlines the key phases involved in building a software project from start to finish.

## About the Document

The PDF file explains the following stages in a clear and structured way:

1. **Requirement Gathering** â€“ Understanding what the client or user needs.
2. **Planning & Analysis** â€“ Choosing technologies and defining features.
3. **System Design** â€“ Creating diagrams, classes, and database design.
4. **Implementation** â€“ Writing and organizing the actual code (e.g., in C#).
5. **Testing** â€“ Ensuring everything works as expected.
6. **Deployment** â€“ Making the software usable in the real world.
7. **Maintenance** â€“ Fixing bugs and improving the system over time.

## Purpose

This document was created as part of my **Makeen Bootcamp** training.  
It serves as a guideline for planning, developing, and maintaining software projects, especially those built using C# and OOP principles.
